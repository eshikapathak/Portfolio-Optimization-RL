# Portfolio-Optimization-RL
18-786 Course Project

This project explores combining a deep reinforcement learning framework with barrier-function based risk controllers for robust portfolio management.

Based off:
- **FinRL Framework**: For more details, refer to the paper available at [FinRL: Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework to Automate Trading in Quantitative Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09395).
- **Black-Box Attack**: For more details, refer to the paper available at [Combining Reinforcement Learning and Barrier Functions for Adaptive Risk Management in Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.07013).
